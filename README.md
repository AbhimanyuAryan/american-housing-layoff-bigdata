#### Abstract

This research project explores the effect of tech layoffs on real estate prices by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that spans from 2017 to 2024. The study leverages four primary data sources: Redfin Housing Market Prices for the years 2017-2022, data extracted directly from Redfin's News Data Center for the years 2022-2024, potential supplementary data from Zillow Group's developers' portal, and a dataset chronicling tech layoffs from 2020 to 2024.

The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations between significant layoff events in the technology sector and subsequent movements in real estate prices across various regions. By integrating and analyzing data on housing market prices alongside tech industry employment trends, the study seeks to provide insights into how the tech sector's employment volatility impacts local and national housing markets.

Preliminary hypotheses suggest that significant tech layoffs lead to short-term depressions in local real estate prices, with variations based on the concentration of tech employment in the area, the price tier of the housing market, and the overall economic conditions.

This research is poised to contribute valuable insights to both the academic field of economic geography and the practical concerns of policymakers, real estate investors, and professionals in the tech industry.
